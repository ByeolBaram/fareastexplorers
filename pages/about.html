            <h2>About Us - Personal</h2>
            <p class="about-us">Our names are Sam and Camden and we are Americans who live abroad in Asia. We met when we were kids and when we say we have always known each other, we quite literally mean it. We moved in across the street from each other before we were even 6 months old. From then on until we turned 18, we grew up and attended school together.</p>
            <p class="about-us">Originally growing up, Sam had expressed that he would like to live abroad, while Camden had no intentions of doing that. Funnily enough, Camden ended up being the first to take that leap and move abroad. At the beginning of our senior year in 2015, Camden decided that he would like to study abroad in South Korea.  He decided that he wanted a change of scenery and wanted to experience what the world had to offer.  South Korea seemed like it would be a good place to start, due to his previous interests in various cultural elements, as well as being a good place to start his Computer Science-based career. Over the next 7 years, he attended language school and university, graduating with a Bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering. During this time, he developed a great love for the culture and way of life in South Korea. Sam’s path to the East took a little bit longer. After graduating university and working in the US for a few years, he decided that he also wanted to take that jump and try something new, and got a job teaching English in Thailand. He’d been interested in Asian culture for many years. It started as a child when he began Tae Kwon Do at the age of 4, and it progressed as he grew up, developing interests that ranged from Sushi to Buddhism. He has lived in Thailand since moving there at the beginning of 2023.</p>

            <h2>Our Goals/Intentions?</h2>
            <p class="about-us">
                After living in and exploring Asia for a while now, we have both become interested in sharing about our living and travel experiences in these countries. While we will be talking about topics like tourist attractions and destinations, we also intend to show you glimpses into our daily lives. When we watch television or Youtube or travel shows, we always like to imagine what it would be like to live in that area. Not just the country, but even the little individual neighborhoods. The parts that you won’t necessarily see and aren’t normally considered worth traveling to, but can actually be a rewarding experience.  For example, the small cafe around the corner from the apartment or the local fish market down the street. We want to show people the real Asia, not just places that are commonly known. We will also be exploring the cultures of these countries, explaining some of the intricacies, traditions, rituals, holidays, etc. Food will be one the other major topics of focus. We plan to show you what kinds of dishes you can find, as well as how the food is made or the history of the particular dishes. Lastly, we want to provide you with helpful advice on traveling and living in Asia, the dos and don’ts, as well as many other helpful tips that will allow you to enjoy your time in the best ways possible.

            <h2>Final Note</h2>
            <p class="about-us">
                We strive to make our content as true to life and ourselves as possible. We hope you can learn and take away a lot of useful information that will help you with your travel or living experience. Maybe we can even convince you to consider making your own attempt to live abroad.  Since this blog is managed by the two of us, we will each be providing our own unique perspectives on the places we go to and have been. This allows us to provide a wide variety of topics and viewpoints on any number of topics. And this may even lead to interesting times, where we cover the same topic from our own perspectives.
